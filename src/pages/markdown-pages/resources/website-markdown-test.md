#### Guide on how to contribute to Celestia

What ways can people contribute in a non-dev way?
- Write a twitter thread
- Write a blog post
- Engage in the forum
- Translate content on the celestia website
- contribute content to the website (learn modular?)
- Open a PR (to the website - this maybe have a tutorial on how to do this since this is for non-devs)
- run a node on devnet (I should be able to make a tutorial on setup up a light node? - if i cant do it then thats a bad sign)
